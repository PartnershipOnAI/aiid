3,Zach Arnold,3. In peer review,Dahlia/Charlie,,"A Boeing 737 MAX aircraft equipped with a new, automated flight control system plunged into the Java Sea, killing 189 people on board. On October 29, 2018, shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Lion Air Flight 610 reported a malfunction in its ""angle of attack"" sensor. Based on faulty readings from the single sensor, the plane's Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) forced the plane's nose down in order to prevent stalling. The pilots pulled the nose back up over twenty times, but the MCAS system counteracted their actions. Eventually, the plane hit the ocean at a speed of several hundred miles per hour. Flight 610 had experienced a similar problem on a previous flight, but in that case, the pilots were able to override MCAS using an emergency procedure. Commentators speculated that the pilots on the day of the fatal crash may have been confused or startled, and that they may not have been fully aware of the MCAS system and how they could override it.","A Boeing 737 crashed into the sea, killing 189 people, after faulty sensor data caused an automated manuevering system to repeatedly push the plane's nose downward.",10/29/2018,10/29/2018,"Java Sea, off the coast of Jakarta",Harm caused,Lion Air; Boeing,Lion Air,For-profit business,,,,,Accident,Critical,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,Yes,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,,,Federal Aviation Administration regulations; Indonesian air safety regulations,"MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System), an aircraft maneuvering system that can autonomously steer the plane based on sensor input",Aircraft sensor data,Boeing,Transportation and storage,No,Expert,High,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,,Aircraft maneuvering; sensor input processing,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,,
