# App Notes

The Discover application plugs into a MongoDB Atlas database for the data and an Algolia instant search index of the associated data. It is independent of the website you are presently reading in scripting context and paths. More information is available in the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid).
