The flexibility afforded by the system architecture, as detailed in the [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08512), means the AI Incident Database does not prescribe a single consensus ontology across all possible problem domains. Organizations with expertise in safety, fairness, and sector or population-specific interests can each develop and manage their own view into the dataset.

# List of Taxonomies

Initially, there is a single taxonomy applied across the incident data. It is a "gold standard" process that involves the definition of classified incident attributes that is made consistent across annotators through a peer review process. For more information on the taxonomy, view the [CSET taxonomy page](/taxonomy/cset).
