# Why "AI Incidents"?

Intelligent systems are currently prone to unforeseen and often dangerous failures when they are deployed to the real world. Much like the transportation sector before it (e.g., [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/accident_incident/) and [FARS](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars)) and more recently [computer systems](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/), intelligent systems require a repository of problems experienced in the real world so that future researchers and developers may mitigate or avoid repeated bad outcomes.

# What is an Incident?

The initial set of more than 1,000 incident reports have been intentionally broad in nature. Current examples include,

* An *autonomous car* [kills a pedestrian](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover?incident_id=4)
* A *trading algorithm* causes a market "[flash crash](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover?incident_id=28)" where billions of dollars transfer between parties
* A *facial recognition system* [causes an innocent person to be arrested](https://incidentdatabase.ai/apps/discover?s=&incident_id=74)

You are invited to [explore the incidents collected to date](/about_apps/1-discover), [view the complete listing](https://incidentdatabase.ai/summaries/incidents), and [submit](/about_apps/2-submit) additional incident reports.

# Current and Future Users

The database is a [constantly evolving](/roadmap) [data product](/develop) and [collection of applications](/apps).

* **Current Users** include system architects, industrial product developers, public relations managers, [researchers](/research), and public policy researchers. These users are invited to use the [Discover](/about_apps/1-discover) application to proactively discover how recently deployed intelligent systems have produced unexpected outcomes in the real world. In so doing, they may avoid making similar mistakes in their development.
* **Future Uses** will [evolve](/roadmap) through the code contributions of the [open source](https://github.com/PartnershipOnAI/aiid) community, including additional database [summaries](/summaries) and [taxonomies](/roadmap).

# When Should You Report an Incident?

When in doubt of whether an event qualifies as an incident, please [submit it](/about_apps/2-submit)! This project is intended to converge on a [shared definition](/research) of "AI Incident" through exploration of the candidate incidents submitted by the broader community.

# Governance

There is a broad base of interest in the AIID as a research and industrial tool. The development of the incident index is managed in a participatory manner by persons and organizations contributing code and incidents. The AIID is supported by the Partnership on AI (PAI) and many of the contributors to the project are associated with partner organizations. The following positions currently exist on the project,

# Steering

People that have contributed significant time and resources to the project.

* [Sean McGregor](https://seanbmcgregor.com/) (XPRIZE Foundation)

# PAI Staff

Staff members at the Partnership on AI developing the project.

* Christine Custis
* Jingying Yang (emeritus)

# Open Source Contributors

People that have contributed more than one pull request to the code base.

* JT McHorse
* Seth Reid (AI Forum of New Zealand)

# Incident Editors

People that resolve incident submissions to the database.

* Sean McGregor (XPRIZE Foundation)

# Incident Contributors

People that have contributed a large numbers of incidents to the database.

* Sam Yoon (as contractor to PAI, now with Deloitte Consulting)
* Catherine Olsson (Google)
* Roman Yampolskiy (University of Louisville)

The following people have collected a large number of incidents that are pending ingestion.

* Zachary Arnold, Ingrid Dickinson, Thomas Giallella, and Nicolina Demakos (Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Georgetown)
* Patrick Hall (Burt and Hall LLP)
* Charlie Pownall (CPC & Associates)
* Roman Lutz (Microsoft)
* Lawrence Lee, Darlena Phuong Quyen Nguyen, Iftekhar Ahmed (UC Irvine)

There is a growing community of people concerned with the collection and characterization of AI incidents, and we encourage everyone to contribute to the development of this system.
